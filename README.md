Airplanes Detection Using Region based Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN)

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the use of the Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN) for airplane detection in aerial images. The notebook includes code for training the model on a set of annotated images and testing its performance on a separate set of images. The data used in this project is also included in the repository. This project is done during one of my master degree subject and it is a beginner level machine learning object detection. Feel free to rum the notebook on learning object detection or comment if any places to improve. Thanks
